# Excel-PivotTables

--Project Overview

The project was aimed at exploring sales data using Excel's powerful Pivot Table features to answer specific business questions and visualize the results through Pivot Charts. The analysis includes multiple pivot tables addressing different sales questions, which are covered in individual worksheets.

--Files in this Repository

1.	Pivot Project Sales Analysis_MAA.xlsx: The Excel file contains the data used for analysis along with various pivot tables and charts across multiple worksheets.
2.	Pivot Project Sales Analysis.docx: A document explaining the step-by-step instructions for each pivot table and chart created. This serves as a guide to understanding how the analysis was performed.

--Steps Performed in the Analysis

The analysis involved the following steps, as detailed in the Word document:

Q1 - Initial Pivot Table Creation:

	Created a basic pivot table to show sales data and set it up in a tabular format.

	Rearranged fields and displayed total sales as a sum.

Q2 - Total Sales by Time and County (Sundays and Mondays in June and July):

	Built a pivot table to display total sales by time (AM, Midday, PM) and region (counties).

	Sorted the regions by total sales in ascending order.

	Added slicers for selecting days and a timeline for date filtering.

	Formatted the table to show currency values with zero decimal places.

Q3 - Displaying Counts as Percentages:

	Created another pivot table to show the sales counts as percentages of the column total.

	Generated a corresponding pivot chart with customized axis bounds.

Q4 - Lowest Total Sale Analysis:

	Determined the time of day with the lowest sales and identified the county with the lowest total sales for that period.

Q5 - Highest Total Sale Analysis:

	Analyzed which county had the highest total sales and the specific day that achieved this.

--Key Insights

•	Temporal Patterns: The project reveals significant differences in sales performance across various times of the day and specific days of the week.

•	Regional Variability: Counties exhibit distinct sales trends, highlighting potential areas for targeted marketing.

•	High and Low Performing Segments: The analysis pinpoints times and locations with the best and worst sales figures, providing actionable insights for improving business strategies.

--Future Improvements

•	Incorporate additional sales dimensions, such as product categories, for deeper insights.

•	Automate the analysis with VBA macros for repeated use.

•	Use Power BI for advanced visualizations and dashboard creation.
